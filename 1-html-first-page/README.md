# 1 HTML | first page

Pathname: 1-html-first-page

The purpose of the exercise is to understand basic html syntax, initially how a menu works and how a most basic architecture (two separeate html-files) of a traditional web page is built. It also provides the opportunity to experiment with user input via forms.

Feel free to experiment with more awesome html element and attribute.

> Do *not* use CSS or JavaScript for this task.

## Startpage

- [ ] Create a new file called index.html
- [ ] Create the following elements
  - doctype
  - html
  - head
  - body
- [ ] Place all necessary meta-tags inside the head, inkluding webbpage-name, description, etc
- [ ] Create the following content, inside correct element
  - a header
  - a heading inside the header-element, with the text "Home"
  - a menu, with two links one called home and and one called contact
  - three longer texts (max 250 words, lorem ipsum), with headings
  - at least two images, where one is in a local folder and the other from a external page on Internet. Use your own images, or download from <https://www.pexels.com/>
  - a button with a link to another webpage on the Internet

## Contact page

- [ ] Create a new file called contact.html
- [ ] Copy-and-paste everything from your index.html file, but change the text in the heading inside the header-element to "Contact us".
- [ ] Link the pages in the menu, so it is possible to navigate between the two web-pages
- [ ] Delete the images, and replace with one new
- [ ] In the contact-file, create a form with at least the following
  - set action to "mailto:firstname.lastname@mymail.eu"
  - a firstname label and an input
  - a lastname label and an input
  - a message label and a textarea
  - a submit and a reset button

... but again, please feel free to add additional content.
